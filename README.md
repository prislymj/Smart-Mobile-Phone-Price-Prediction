# Smart Mobile Phone Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
```
The notebook presents a study on prediction of the price of a smart phone using machine learning algorithms, given its input. We also aim to identify what other machine learning algorithms can be used to get a better prediction. Regression models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, KNN(k-nearest neighbors algorithm), Decision Tree regression, and Classification models like Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest Classifier and SVM(Support Vector Machine) were experimented with.
